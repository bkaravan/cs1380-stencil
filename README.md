# distribution

This is the distribution library. When loaded, distribution introduces functionality supporting the distributed execution of programs. To download it:

## Installation

```sh
$ npm i '@brown-ds/distribution'
```

This command downloads and installs the distribution library.

## Testing

There are several categories of tests:
  *	Regular Tests (`*.test.js`)
  *	Scenario Tests (`*.scenario.js`)
  *	Extra Credit Tests (`*.extra.test.js`)
  * Student Tests (`*.student.test.js`) - inside `test/test-student`

### Running Tests

By default, all regular tests are run. Use the options below to run different sets of tests:

1. Run all regular tests (default): `$ npm test` or `$ npm test -- -t`
2. Run scenario tests: `$ npm test -- -c` 
3. Run extra credit tests: `$ npm test -- -ec`
4. Run the `non-distribution` tests: `$ npm test -- -nd`
5. Combine options: `$ npm test -- -c -ec -nd -t`

## Usage

To import the library, be it in a JavaScript file or on the interactive console, run:

```js
let distribution = require("@brown-ds/distribution");
```

Now you have access to the full distribution library. You can start off by serializing some values. 

```js
let s = distribution.util.serialize(1); // '{"type":"number","value":"1"}'
let n = distribution.util.deserialize(s); // 1
```

You can inspect information about the current node (for example its `sid`) by running:

```js
distribution.local.status.get('sid', console.log); // 8cf1b
```

You can also store and retrieve values from the local memory:

```js
distribution.local.mem.put({name: 'nikos'}, 'key', console.log); // {name: 'nikos'}
distribution.local.mem.get('key', console.log); // {name: 'nikos'}
```

You can also spawn a new node:

```js
let node = { ip: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080 };
distribution.local.status.spawn(node, console.log);
```

Using the `distribution.all` set of services will allow you to act 
on the full set of nodes created as if they were a single one.

```js
distribution.all.status.get('sid', console.log); // { '8cf1b': '8cf1b', '8cf1c': '8cf1c' }
```

You can also send messages to other nodes:

```js
distribution.all.comm.send(['sid'], {node: node, service: 'status', method: 'get'}, console.log); // 8cf1c
```

# Results and Reflections

> # M1: Serialization / Deserialization


## Summary

> My implementation is within distribution/util/serializaiton.js file. I levereged switch statements and took the recursive approach to serialize objects/arrays, as well JSON.parsee and JSON.stringify. The main challange was definitely figuring out the circular reference part for the lab. I was trying to use a map from objects to IDs first, but then I came with a way to pass in the parent of the current recursive call, so that the map can be updated with it instead. 


My implementation comprises of 1software components, totaling around 150 lines of code. As mentioned, key challenges included figuring out the proper object map for circular references, and traversing the native functions (which was just a way of getting used to how it's done in JS).


## Correctness & Performance Characterization


> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation


*Correctness*: I wrote 5 tests; these tests take 0.736s to execute. This includes objects with all kinds of features that we want to serialize: objects, arrays, dates, errors, and permutations of basic types. I noticed that both my implementation and the provided library are struggling to serialize/deserialize an object with a named function within it, and I was wondering if this is intended.


*Performance*: The latency of various subsystems is described in the `"latency"` portion of package.json. Latency is measured in ms, since it is rather quick to serialize/deserialize an in-memory object. The characteristics of my development machines are summarized in the `"dev"` portion of package.json.



# M2: Actors and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)


## Summary

> This milestone covered the get, route, and comm services, as well as createRPC function and some endpoint handling in node.js. The hardest part was honestly debugging, since in routing protocols, it is difficult to track when things go wrong (for example, I was missing a "/" in my path in send, and for about an hour could not understand why does nothing every gets anywhere)


My implementation comprises 5 software components, totaling around 300 lines of code. Key challenges included understanding the callback and event driven code structure, setting up communication between send and node.js, and creating the RPCstub. Some bugs were quite difficult to track, but conceptually, understanding callbacks and creating the stub were the most difficult parts. It felt like the lecture covered the stub pretty well, but I still struggled to put where does each part go. 


## Correctness & Performance Characterization

> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation


*Correctness*: I wrote 5 required + 2 timed tests; these tests take from 1-2ms to execute on quick local functions to 40ms on an rpc call.


*Performance*: I characterized the performance of comm and RPC by sending 1000 service requests in a tight loop. Average throughput and latency is recorded in `package.json`. The latency is recorded in seconds, and throughput is in request/second.


## Key Feature

> How would you explain the implementation of `createRPC` to someone who has no background in computer science â€” i.e., with the minimum jargon possible?
Imagine that you have a friend who has a jar of cookies. Only he knows how many cookies are in that jar. Sometimes, you really wonder just how many cookies are in that jar, but you don't know. To tell you, your friend wrote down instructions on how to ask him and his phone number. Now, anytime you wonder, you call his phone and get his number of cookies, even if they change sometimes.
